# 🎓 Edu Pulse  
### Smart Student Performance & Learning Advisory System

Edu Pulse is a role-based academic monitoring and learning advisory system designed to help educational institutions track student performance, identify academic risks, and provide actionable insights for improvement.

This project is developed as an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) focusing on system design, user experience, and role-based workflow rather than full backend integration.
